# Shai-Hulud Scanner

## Overview

The Shai-Hulud worm is a self-replicating supply chain attack that compromises npm packages by injecting malicious code during installation. This scanner detects infections by checking for known compromised packages, malicious files, and suspicious indicators — covering **both the original Shai-Hulud wave and the newer Sha1-Hulud “Second Coming” Bun-based variant**.

---

## What is Shai-Hulud?

On September 14, 2025, Shai-Hulud — a self-replicating npm worm (malicious code that propagates itself automatically, infecting new targets without direct human intervention) — burst onto the scene by compromising over 180 popular packages in the registry.

Attackers:

- Phished maintainer accounts to obtain npm and GitHub access
- Released tainted versions containing heavily obfuscated JavaScript (a monolithic `bundle.js`)
- Hooked into the `postinstall` phase of `npm install`
- Ran TruffleHog locally to hunt for secrets
- Double-base64-encoded the stolen data and exfiltrated it to attacker-controlled endpoints
- Used the stolen tokens to:
  - Republish additional owned packages
  - Flip private GitHub repositories to public via “-migration” forks

## What is Sha1-Hulud / “The Second Coming”?

In late November 2025, a new wave of attacks appeared in the npm ecosystem, often referred to as **Sha1-Hulud**, **Shai-Hulud 2.0**, or **“Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.”**

Instead of a `postinstall` `bundle.js`, this wave focuses on a **fake Bun runtime** theme:

- Compromised packages add a **`preinstall` hook** that runs `node setup_bun.js`
- `setup_bun.js` drops or installs Bun (if needed) and then executes a large, heavily obfuscated payload (`bun_environment.js`, >10 MB)
- The payload:
  - Steals npm, GitHub, and cloud credentials
  - Targets CI/CD environments (especially GitHub Actions) to harvest high-value secrets
  - Uses GitHub repositories as “dropboxes” with descriptions like **“Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.”**
  - Stores stolen data in files such as:
    - `actionsSecrets.json`
    - `cloud.json`
    - `contents.json`
    - `environment.json`
    - `truffleSecrets.json`

Multiple vendors have reported **thousands of malicious packages and tens of thousands of GitHub repos** created in this second wave.

## What is Shai-Hulud-Scanner?

**Shai-Hulud Scanner is a fast, open-source CLI tool to help developers and security teams detect and mitigate both:**

- The original **Shai-Hulud** `bundle.js` npm worm, and  
- The newer **Sha1-Hulud “Second Coming”** fake Bun runtime variant (`setup_bun.js` + `bun_environment.js`).

Motivated by the worm’s rapid spread and impact on the npm ecosystem, this scanner provides proactive threat detection using:

- An up-to-date list of compromised packages
- File and hash checks (including large Bun payloads)
- Git history analysis
- GitHub and GitHub Actions workflow scanning

It’s free, community-driven, and designed to keep projects safe from npm supply chain attacks.

## Features

- **Dependency Scanning**
  - Parses `package.json` and lockfiles (npm, Yarn, PNPM)
  - Compares dependencies against a curated `affected-packages.json` list (v1 and v2 waves)

- **File Analysis**
  - Detects known malicious `bundle.js` payloads using SHA-256 hashes
  - Flags suspicious second-wave payloads like `setup_bun.js` and `bun_environment.js`
  - Supports scanning large JavaScript payloads (10MB+)

- **IOC Detection**
  - Searches for high-signal indicators of compromise across source and config files, including:
    - `shai-hulud`, `sha1-hulud`, and “Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming”
    - Exfil URLs and webhook IDs
    - Suspicious JSON dumps: `actionsSecrets.json`, `truffleSecrets.json`, `cloud.json`, `environment.json`, `contents.json`
    - Traces of TruffleHog-based secret scraping

- **Git Repository Analysis**
  - Scans local Git history for:
    - Suspicious branches and commit messages
    - Added/remotely-injected `bundle.js`, `setup_bun.js`, `bun_environment.js`
    - Potentially malicious GitHub Actions workflows

- **GitHub Integration (Optional)**
  - Given a PAT and org name, scans:
    - Repos for suspicious descriptions (e.g. “Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming”)
    - Files and workflows for Shai-/Sha1-Hulud markers

- **Workflow Scanning**
  - `--scan-workflows` analyzes `.github/workflows/*.yml` files for shady behaviors:
    - Obfuscated commands
    - Secret dumps into JSON files
    - Potential Sha1-Hulud exfil patterns

- **Secrets Simulation**
  - `--scan-secrets` simulates what the worm would try to steal by scanning for exposed secrets locally

- **Automated Remediation**
  - `--remediate` can automatically remove compromised packages from your project

- **Multi-format Lockfile Support**
  - Works with:
    - `package-lock.json` (npm)
    - `yarn.lock`
    - `pnpm-lock.yaml`

- **JSON Output**
  - Machine-readable results for CI/CD pipelines and security tooling

## Remediation Steps

When issues are detected:

1. **Rotate Credentials**  
   Immediately rotate all tokens (npm, GitHub, cloud providers, CI secrets, etc.).

2. **Remove Bad Packages**  
   Use the `--remediate` flag or manually uninstall compromised dependencies.

3. **Clean Install**  
   Remove `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies from a clean lockfile.

4. **Verify**  
   Re-run the scanner to confirm cleanup and ensure no residual indicators remain.

5. **Monitor**  
   Review recent commits, GitHub Actions runs, and access logs for unauthorized changes or suspicious activity.
